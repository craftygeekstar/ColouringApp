Problem: I am trying to to convert the PlayerController script for the XR input system.
I don't know how to change the OnMouseDown() to VR controller. 

I have the trigger input working: The cube changing colour black/white shows the controller input is working.
The script I've been working on is attached to the cube : RotateCube_CustomInput (named from the previous thing it was going to do... sorry).
I've tried a lot of different ways to get this to work and I've been close but I don't know what to do.


Other Context:
MarkerMovement controls the movement of the marker pen.

The previous version of the app is in the Sample Scene.
It renders a texture on the whiteboard. But it runs so slowly.
If you can think of a way of making this run faster then I could use that, but I don't know why it's so slow.
